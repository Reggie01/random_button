# random_button

[Codepen](https://codepen.io/Reggie01/full/OJoQKmP)

This codepen challenge is to "create a Pen with a button that does something random". The codepen starts with button presses randomizing the background. I added a way to prevent the same background being selected twice in a row. Next, I randomized the size of the button. Lastly, I randomized the style of the button using some of Google Material design principles.
